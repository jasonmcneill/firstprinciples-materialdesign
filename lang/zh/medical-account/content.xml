			This led me first to a study of the practice of crucifixion itself; that is, torture and execution by fixation to a cross. Apparently, the first known practice of crucifixion was by the Persians. Alexander and his generals brought it back to the Mediterranean world — to Egypt and to Carthage. The Romans apparently learned the practice from the Carthaginians and (as with almost everything the Romans did) rapidly developed a very high degree of efficiency and skill at it. A number of Roman authors (Livy, Cicero, Tacitus) comment on crucifixion, and several innovations, modifications, and variations are described in the ancient literature.

			折磨到最后被钉在十架上处死，这开始让我想要研究十架这个酷刑。显而易见的是， 最早实践钉十字架的是波斯人。 亚历山大和他的军官们把十架带到了地中海地区 — 带到了埃及和迦太基。 罗马人从迦太基人那学到了十架， 快速的掌握了“技巧”并进一步的“发扬光大”， 不同的早期文献里记载了十架的创新，调整和不一样的变式。

			For instance, the upright portion of the cross (or stipes) could have the cross-arm (or patibulum) attached two or three feet below its top in what we commonly think of as the Latin cross. The most common form used in our Lord's day, however, was the Tau cross, shaped like our T. In this cross the patibulum was placed in a notch at the top of the stipes. There is archeological evidence that it was on this type of cross that Jesus was crucified.
		</original>
		<translated>
			比如说， 今天我们想到的十架其实是拉丁十架 — 十架的横杠在竖杠顶端往下一点的位置穿过。但在耶稣的时代，最常用的十架却是tau十架，形状更像一个T字，这个十架的横杠在竖杠的顶端。有考古证据证明这才是钉死耶稣的十架。

			Without any historical or Biblical proof, Medieval and Renaissance painters have given us our picture of Christ carrying the entire cross. But the upright post, or stipes, was generally fixed permanently in the ground at the site of execution and the condemned man was forced to carry the patibulum, weighing about 110 pounds, from the prison to the place of execution.

		<translated>
			在没有历史和圣经的证据下， 中世纪和文艺复兴世代的画家为我们描述了耶稣背十架的画面。但十架的竖杠其实已经固定在处刑的地方了，从监狱到处刑地， 囚犯需要背的是十架的横杠 — 约110磅。

			Many of the painters and most of the sculptors of crucifixion, also show the nails through the palms. Historical Roman accounts and experimental work have established that the nails were driven between the small bones of the wrists (radius and ulna) and not through the palms. Nails driven through the palms will strip out between the fingers when made to support the weight of the human body. The misconception may have come about through a misunderstanding of Jesus' words to Thomas, "Observe my hands." Anatomists, both modern and ancient, have always considered the wrist as part of the hand.
		</original>
		<translated>
			许多画家和雕塑家的作品里， 十架的钉子是穿过手心。 但罗马历史告诉我们十架的钉子是钉在手腕上骨头之间， 因为如果钉在手掌上， 当承受全身重量时，钉子会从手指间滑落。 为什么人们会认为钉子在手掌上， 可能是因为对耶稣对马多所说的话的误解 — “看看我的手吧”。 以前以及现在的解剖学家一直都认为手腕是手的一部分。

			But, of course, the physical passion of the Christ began in Gethsemane. Of the many aspects of this initial suffering, the one of greatest physiological interest is the bloody sweat. It is interesting that St. Luke, the physician, is the only one to mention this. He says, "And being in agony, He prayed the longer. And His sweat became as drops of blood, trickling down upon the ground."

			Every ruse (trick) imaginable has been used by modern scholars to explain away this description, apparently under the mistaken impression that this just doesn't happen. A great deal of effort could have been saved had the doubters consulted the medical literature. Though very rare, the phenomenon of Hematidrosis, or bloody sweat, is well documented. Under great emotional stress of the kind our Lord suffered, tiny capillaries in the sweat glands can break, thus mixing blood with sweat. This process might well have produced marked weakness and possible shock.

			很多近代学者都尝试要解释圣经的这一段有关「血汗」的词组，曾有很多人就断言那是凭想象的事。其实翻开医学文献，非常罕见的Hematidrosis(即bloodysweat血汗)是有明确的记载:『一个人在极度的情绪压力下，汗腺中的极小微血管会破裂，以致血和汗混在一起流出。』虽然这不是和身体的创伤有关，但这是耶稣受难过程中第一种痛苦。

			After the arrest in the middle of the night, Jesus was next brought before the Sanhedrin and Caiphus, the High Priest; it is here that the first physical trauma was inflicted. A soldier struck Jesus across the face for remaining silent when questioned by Caiphus. The palace guards then blind-folded Him and mockingly taunted Him to identify them as they each passed by, spat upon Him, and struck Him in the face.

			In the early morning, battered and bruised, dehydrated, and exhausted from a sleepless night, Jesus is taken across the Praetorium of the Fortress Antonia, the seat of government of the Procurator of Judea, Pontius Pilate. You are, of course, familiar with Pilate's action in attempting to pass responsibility to Herod Antipas, the Tetrarch of Judea. Jesus apparently suffered no physical mistreatment at the hands of Herod and was returned to Pilate. It was then, in response to the cries of the mob, that Pilate ordered Bar-Abbas released and condemned Jesus to scourging and crucifixion.

			There is much disagreement among authorities about the unusual scourging as a prelude to crucifixion. Most Roman writers from this period do not associate the two. Many scholars believe that Pilate originally ordered Jesus scourged as his full punishment and that the death sentence by crucifixion came only in response to the taunt by the mob that the Procurator was not properly defending Caesar against this pretender who allegedly claimed to be the King of the Jews.

			Preparations for the scourging were carried out when the Prisoner was stripped of His clothing and His hands tied to a post above His head.

			The Roman legionnaire steps forward with the flagrum (or flagellum) in his hand. This is a short whip consisting of several heavy, leather thongs with two small balls of lead attached near the ends of each. The heavy whip is brought down with full force again and again across Jesus' shoulders, back, and legs. At first the thongs cut through the skin only. Then, as the blows continue, they cut deeper into the subcutaneous tissues, producing first an oozing of blood from the capillaries and veins of the skin, and finally spurting arterial bleeding from vessels in the underlying muscles.

			他们用来打犯人的是一种短短的鞭子，每个鞭子有好几根强韧的皮条，每根皮条的顶端带着几个铅做的小球。照规矩兵丁要用他最大最猛的力气使劲挥起这个重实的皮鞭抽下去。耶稣的肩膀、背后、和腿上都是这样被猛烈地抽打着。最初，这些重实的皮条只是割破表皮而已。后来，这些皮条就切进皮下组织的深层，造成皮肤微血管和小静脉破裂，血汨汨地往外渗。最后连肌肉里较大的动脉也破了，血就一直不断地流出来。

			The small balls of lead first produce large, deep bruises which are broken open by subsequent blows.

When it is determined by the centurion in charge that the prisoner is near death, the beating is finally stopped.

			The half-fainting Jesus is then untied and allowed to slump to the stone pavement, wet with His own blood. The Roman soldiers see a great joke in this provincial Jew claiming to be king. They throw a robe across His shoulders and place a stick in His hand for a scepter. They still need a crown to make their travesty complete. Flexible branches covered with long thorns (commonly used in bundles for firewood) are plaited into the shape of a crown and this is pressed into His scalp. Again there is copious bleeding, the scalp being one of the most vascular areas of the body.

			已经昏死过去的耶稣两手被松绑之后，就跌趴在石头地上，全身都是自己所流的湿湿的血。罗马兵丁看着这个卑微的、半死的耶稣，对他曾经称自己是犹太人的王，充满了讥笑与不屑。他们绑了一件袍子在他肩上，在他手里放一根苇子当令牌。他们还需要一个王冠，于是他们用荆棘（一种户外烤火时用来拨弄炉火的棘刺很长的植物枝子）弯起来编成一个王冠戴在他的头上。这个王冠被压到头皮上时，长长的刺割破血管丰富的组织，鲜血从头皮不断地流到脸上和头颈。

			After mocking Him and striking Him across the face, the soldiers take the stick from His hand and strike Him across the head, driving the thorns deeper into His scalp. Finally, they tire of their sadistic sport and the robe is torn from His back. Already having adhered to the clots of blood and serum in the wounds, its removal causes excruciating pain just as in the careless removal of a surgical bandage, and almost as though He were again being whipped the wounds once more begin to bleed.

			嘲弄完了，他们拿苇子打他的头，头上荆冠被打到动来动去，许多伤口划得更深更长。最后他们玩腻了，就从耶稣的背上把袍子扒掉。袍子早已被凝固的血液和血清粘在伤口上，这样粗鲁地扒下来让奄奄一息的耶稣背上一阵剧烈疼痛，鲜血又从已经干涸的伤口涌出来。

			In deference to Jewish custom, the Romans return His garments. The heavy patibulum of the cross is tied across His shoulders, and the procession of the condemned Christ, two thieves, and the execution detail of Roman soldiers headed by a centurion begins its slow journey along the Via Dolorosa. In spite of His efforts to walk erect, the weight of the heavy wooden beam, together with the shock produced by copious blood loss, is too much. He stumbles and falls. The rough wood of the beam gouges into the lacerated skin and muscles of the shoulders. He tries to rise, but human muscles have been pushed beyond their endurance.

			按照犹太人的习俗，兵丁显然是把耶稣原来穿的衣服又还给了他。他们把十字架重重的横木绑在耶稣肩上，和另外两个强盗由一个百夫长带队，缓缓走到行刑的地点。这一段路大约六百公尺。 尽管耶稣努力站立着向前走，但是木头巨大的重量，加上先前流过许多血，他跌倒了。粗糙的木头划破并扎进他颈项和肩头的皮肤与肌肉。他尝试要站起来，但是没有足够的力气。

			Jesus is offered wine mixed with myrrh, a mild analgesic mixture. He refuses to drink. Simon is ordered to place the patibulum on the ground and Jesus quickly thrown backward with His shoulders against the wood. The legionnaire feels for the depression at the front of the wrist. He drives a heavy, square, wrought-iron nail through the wrist and deep into the wood. Quickly, he moves to the other side and repeats the action being careful not to pull the arms too tightly, but to allow some flexion and movement. The patibulum is then lifted in place at the top of the stipes and the titulus reading "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews" is nailed in place.

			钉十字架开始了。兵丁拿苦胆（一种轻度麻醉剂）调的酒给耶稣喝，他没有接受。他们命令西满把横木放在地上，然后把耶稣放倒，肩膀靠在那根木头上。一个兵丁在耶稣一边的手腕找着没有骨头经过的地方，将一根方方的粗铁钉从他手腕的那里深深钉进木头去，另外一边也同样。钉的时候他们特别注意不使两臂伸得太紧，让犯人有一点屈张身体的空间。然后他们把横木和直木固定好，再在直木上端钉了一个牌子，写着“纳匝肋人耶稣，犹太人的君王”。

			The left foot is now pressed backward against the right foot, and with both feet extended, toes down, a nail is driven through the arch of each, leaving the knees moderately flexed. The victim is now crucified. As He slowly sags down with more weight on the nails in the wrists excruciating pain shoots along the fingers and up the arms to explode in the brain. As He pushes Himself upward to avoid this stretching torment, He places His full weight on the nail through His feet. Again there is the searing agony of the nail tearing through the nerves between the metatarsal bones of the feet.

			At this point, as the arms fatigue, great waves of cramps sweep over the muscles, knotting them in deep, relentless, throbbing pain. With these cramps comes the inability to push Himself upward. Hanging by His arms, the pectoral muscles are paralyzed and the intercostal muscles are unable to act. Air can be drawn into the lungs, but cannot be exhaled. Jesus fights to raise Himself in order to get even one short breath. Finally, carbon dioxide builds up in the lungs and in the blood stream and the cramps partially subside. Spasmodically, He is able to push Himself upward to exhale and bring in the life-giving oxygen. It was undoubtedly during these periods that He uttered the seven short sentences recorded:

			在这样痛苦的挣扎中发生了另一个现象。手臂渐渐疲乏无力，肌肉开始一阵阵剧烈的痉挛抽搐，造成连续不断的剧烈痛苦。这时候耶稣失去了控制双臂肌肉的能力，躯干垂挂在两臂下，大胸肌（pectoral muscles，胸部的大肌肉）麻痹了，肋间肌（in－tercostal muscles ，肋骨间的小肌肉）没有办法工作；空气可以吸入肺里，可是没有办法呼出来。耶稣挣扎着把身躯顶上来一点，好稍稍换一口气。终于他肺中和血液里的二氧化碳浓度升高到一个程度，肌肉痉挛稍稍缓和了点。 他暂时能够随着痉挛的抽动将身躯往上顶一下、顶一下，让肺里的空气得到一点交换。他的七言是在这样痛苦、短促的呼吸中说出来的。

			用最后所能挤出来的一点气力，他把扯裂的脚向那根钉子拼命一蹬，把腿伸直，换了最后一口气，说完“父啊，我把我的灵魂交托在你手中”就死了。

			The rest you know. In order that the Sabbath not be profaned, the Jews asked that the condemned men be dispatched and removed from the crosses. The common method of ending a crucifixion was by crucifracture, the breaking of the bones of the legs. This prevented the victim from pushing himself upward; thus the tension could not be relieved from the muscles of the chest and rapid suffocation occurred. The legs of the two thieves were broken, but when the soldiers came to Jesus they saw that this was unnecessary.

			钉十字架通常是用打断犯人双腿来结束生命的，这叫做 crurifracture。打断双腿的作用是不让他们再能将身躯往上推，胸部肌肉的紧绷就没有办法放松，犯人没有办法换气，很快就窒息死了。那两个强盗的腿都被打断，但当兵丁走到耶稣跟前，发现他已经断了气，就没有去打他的腿。

			Apparently to make doubly sure of death, the legionnaire drove his lance through the fifth interspace between the ribs, upward through the pericardium and into the heart. The 34th verse of the 19th chapter of the Gospel according to St. John reports: "And immediately there came out blood and water." That is, there was an escape of water fluid from the sac surrounding the heart, giving postmortem evidence that our Lord died not the usual crucifixion death by suffocation, but of heart failure due to shock and constriction of the heart by fluid in the pericardium.

			为了保证耶稣确实已死，兵丁拿枪刺进耶稣的肋骨间，一直刺进心脏里面。心包腔的水和心脏里面的血就从伤口流出来。很明显地，耶稣的直接死因是由于缺水休克以及心包腔收缩压迫所引起的心脏衰竭，而不是一般钉十架者死亡的原因。

			Thus we have had our glimpse — including the medical evidence — of that epitome of evil which man has exhibited toward man and toward God. It has been a terrible sight, and more than enough to leave us despondent and depressed. How grateful we can be that we have the great sequel in the infinite mercy of God toward man — at once the miracle of the atonement and the expectation of the triumphant Easter morning.

			在这我们就有了对耶稣受难记的大概了解 — 包括医疗证据 — 以及人类对人和神邪恶的行为的缩影。 这令人寒颤的行为足以让我们感到沮丧和绝望， 耶稣的被钉十字架并不是那一段历史的终结，而是一个开始；因为耶稣的受难及复活，产生了永世的功效:那就是上帝对人类无止境慈爱的呈现，使世人的灵魂不至灭亡反得永生。
