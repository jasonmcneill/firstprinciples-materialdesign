					Philip and the Ethiopian
				</p>
				Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, "Go south to the road — the desert road — that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza."
			</verse>
			<verse number="27" number-en="27">
				So he started out, and on his way he met an Ethiopian eunuch, an important official in charge of all the treasury of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians. This man had gone to Jerusalem to worship,

			<verse number="28" number-en="28">
				and on his way home was sitting in his chariot reading the book of Isaiah the prophet.
			</verse>
			<verse number="29" number-en="29">
				The Spirit told Philip, "Go to that chariot and stay near it."
			</verse>
			<verse number="30" number-en="30">
				Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. "Do you understand what you are reading?" Philip asked.
			</verse>
			<verse number="31" number-en="31">
				"How can I," he said, "unless someone explains it to me?" So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
			</verse>
			<verse number="32" number-en="32" scripturequote="true">
				The eunuch was reading this passage of Scripture: <span class="scripturequote">"He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before the shearer is silent, so he did not open his mouth.</span>
			</verse>
			<verse number="33" number-en="33" scripturequote="true">
				<span class="scripturequote">In his humiliation he was deprived of justice. Who can speak of his descendants? For his life was taken from the earth."</span>
			</verse>
			<verse number="34" number-en="34">
				The eunuch asked Philip, "Tell me, please, who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?"
			</verse>
			<verse number="35" number-en="35">
				Then Philip began with that very passage of Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus.
			</verse>
			<verse number="36" number-en="36">
				As they traveled along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch said, "Look, here is water. Why shouldn't I be baptized?"
			</verse>
			<verse number="38" number-en="38">
				And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him.
			</verse>
			<verse number="39" number-en="39">
				When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing.
